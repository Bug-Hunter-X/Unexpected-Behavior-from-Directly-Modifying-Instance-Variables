This repository demonstrates a common Ruby bug related to directly modifying instance variables outside of defined methods.  The `bug.rb` file shows the issue where directly altering `@value` bypasses any intended logic or validation within the class.  The solution in `bugSolution.rb` showcases the preferred approach using accessor methods (`attr_accessor`, `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`).
